# Data Wrangling Process Example

## Summary
This project is a data wrangling process example as part of a Data Analyst Nanodegree of [Udacity]([https://www.udacity.com/](https://www.udacity.com/)) course. The aim of this project is elaborate the multiple process involved in the data wrangling:
* Gathering data from multiple data sources.
* Asessing data.
* Cleaning data.

And finally performing a data exploration of the cleaned data.

You may find the full process on the main [Jupyter Notebook of this project](data-wrangling.ipynb).


## Getting Started
This project is developed in Python 3 on Jupyter Notebook and an environment file is provided in order to replicate all requirements. In order to replicate the environment next command line should be executed from root project folder.
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
You may need install Conda as environment manager and Python versions. [Here]([https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual)) you may find how to do it.
